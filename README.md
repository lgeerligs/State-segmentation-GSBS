# State-segmentation-GSBS
This repository contains the code that was used in the paper 'Detecting neural state transitions underlying event segmentation'

The method that we developed for detecting state boundaries is implemented in the Python package 'statesegmentation': https://pypi.org/project/statesegmentation/

The scripts included here show the setup of our simulations and real data analyses. 
The simulations scripts are defined in simulations_methods_comparisons.py, while the script simulations_show_results.py runs the analyses and produces the plots in the paper. 
Similarly, the real data analyis scripts are defined in real_data_analyses.py, while the script real_data_analyses_show_results.py runs the analyses and produces the plots and statistics in the paper. 
The searchlight data used for in the real data analyses can be downloaded from:  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4714881
